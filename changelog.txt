[1.3.5] - 2026-02-13

- Added the ability to choose where Supremacy specific files exist. I didn't test it much so don't get mad if it breaks. (The folder picker is kinda buggy tho)
- Added disk space check for install/update/repair actions (With Wine/Proton detection so it shouldn't just yell at the linux users if they somehow got it to work)
- Removed the Alternate GC Status / Options as the Alternate GC is being phased out and will soon not exist.
- I don't know what else to write here, usually there's a meme patch note but just pretend that this is interesting or whatever.

[1.3.4] - 2026-01-15

- Forgot to add a check to cancel auto launch in case of an update
- Added Herobrine

[1.3.3] - 2026-01-14

Happy New Year (even if i'm a bit late)
I've been super burned out mentally but hey i'm trying to get back into the swing of things :)

- Moved the Changelog button for the Launcher
- Moved the Troubleshooting button
- Added less shit icons that render properly

- Added the option to keep the launcher open (Yes I know, I should have added that already)
- Added an Auto Launch option + Cancel button (so you can still use the GUI if needed)
- Potentially fixed Detection issues for the SupremacyRenewed folder? I don't know since i've never been able to successfully test why it doesn't do it right the first time in certain conditions.
- Added Azzie (No I will not elaborate, but Azzie did the new logo so share your love for the work she does.)
- Eric continues to judge you (He is rapidly approaching your location)

[1.3.2] - 2025-12-29

- Minor Update to fix Alternate GC checkbox not populating when the setting is enabled
- Moved the Troubleshooting section to Github to allow me to update it without updating the launcher every single time.

[1.3.1] - 2025-12-26

Christmas Update - A little too late to be festive with the launcher so this will have to do.

- Reworked the play button override into "Trust Mode", this will force the launcher to trust any paths you give it even if they're wrong.
** As a Side Effect, because the play button also overwrites your gameinfo.txt with the csgo path set, if it's incorrect then you will experience the missing background error **

- Merged CSGO path detection logic (Not that you'd need to know that)
- Merged Steam Detection Logic (Also something you don't see, just like the csgo logic)
- This update is kind of a bit of a Logic and behind the scenes fixes. I wanted to very much rewrite the entire thing but I do not hold the sanity needed for that.

- Trying to install too quickly will cause the launcher to pause and say the update server isn't available. it is. it's lying to you. No I don't know how to fix it but if you wait 10 seconds then it'll work.
- Alternatively, if after 2-3 minutes it says that updates/install still aren't available, it's not lying to you and I have no idea why you can't fetch the update/install info.

- If I put all of the changes I made into this changelog, I would go clinically insane. Mostly because 90% of the changes are all internal logic and none of the people using this launcher has ever seen it.
- Removed even more sanity (Didn't know it was possible but I did it)
- Kicked Herobrine out (wasn't paying rent)

- Added a troubleshooting section for the launcher.

- Also Hi, if you read this changelog I appreciate you. Watch Silo and Severance (the AppleTV shows), they're pretty neat. Definitely worth the watch.

[1.3.0] - 2025-12-21

- Added additional check for if legacy needs to be launched once (The launcher has to check for csgo somehow, it won't work if you don't do the basic setup)

[1.2.9] - 2025-12-21

- Fixed CSGO Detection, less reliant on Steam Detection (I don't even know why I did that in the first place)
- Manually Selecting your Counter-Strike Global Offensive Directory (if valid) should now allow you to play regardless of Steam install location -

[1.2.7/1.2.8] - Same Day

- Fixed dodgy gameinfo.txt update. Forgot to enforce edit only so it decided to add whatever wherever it wanted. For sanity sake I hope this fixed it.

[1.2.6] - 2025-12-20

- Reworked Repair logic (so it doesn't infinitely spiral) (The End is Never The End is Never The End is Never The End is Never )
- Reworked Gameinfo.txt logic so that it *should* replace it with the correct directory path now
- Reworked the patch manager (so it shouldn't hang indefinitely on slow downloads)
- Improved Steam detection (for those of you with half installs lurking on your PC)
- Improved Legacy Detection (it was working fine on my side but everyone's setup is different)
- Split the updater + Shrunk it (for those of you who use my bloated one still, sorry.)
- Should be more Antivirus Friendly (Because it used to spam the hell out of search requests looking for CSGO/Steam) 
- Herobrine broke in, I didn't add him back but he's here... Somehow
- Added Fish

[1.2.5]

- Removed Downgrading the steam client. (This issue is now fixed with removing the steam crash handler for the latest update)
- Removed Herobrine
- Added Azzies infinite wisdom.

[1.2.4]

- Added automatic update suppression for steam updates. Please read the prompts during the downgrade process.

[1.2.3]

- Added Steam Downgrade button (Valve PLEASE stop making me do things)

[1.2.2] - 2025-12-19

- Stripped out debug function I forgot to remove
- Reverted steam beta banner update (steam updated the same heckin day I do this? Really???)

[1.2.1] - 2025-12-19

- Added warning banner for users on the Steam Client Beta (Since legacy won't launch when you use the client beta)
- Added Debug logging (minimal) to settings.

[1.2.0] - 2025-12-13

- Changed update logic to allow updating if the download server can be contacted with the play button override enabled
- Changed update logic to be more reliable with multi-patch updates
- Added progress indicator for launcher updates (This is untested, but it compiled so fuck it we ball)
- Streamlined the update logic to be generally more reliable; this includes not leaving all the update logic/version checking to a single threaded function.
- Patch 1.1.8 included new update notifications for install/update states, this should also be more reliable (via the Eric/Scoobert images)
- Added additional protections for install/repair logic so that you won't wipe your suprem files because of my mistakes.
- Added additional checks for update sources so that repair/install/update functions shouldn't fail (or be permissive if the update sources are unreachable)
- Removed Sanity
- Added Herobrine (He said sorry for the patch v0 update issues)

[1.1.8] - 2025-12-12

- Added Eric
- Added Scoobert

[1.1.7] - 2025-12-11

Normalized CSGO pathing so the gameinfo.txt doesn't end up with /csgo/csgo by accident.

[1.1.6] - 2025-12-09

- Improved Handling of gameinfo.txt (to avoid issues when people download the repack)
- Gameinfo.txt in SupremacyRenewed/csgo will automatically update to path from settings (For users who use the repack instead of the launcher to install)

[1.1.4]/[1.1.5] - 2025-12-07

(This is a minor update but important as american ISPs are starting to block my personal websites, including the one that handles the launcher updates.)

- Migrate launcher updates to Alternate Source
- Migrate launcher changelogs to Alternate source
- I am too lazy to revert back to 1.1.4 after testing so this is where we're at now.
