- Added Steam Downgrade button (Valve PLEASE stop making me do things)

[1.2.2] - 2025-12-19

- Reverted steam beta banner update (steam updated the same heckin day I do this? Really???)

[1.2.1] - 2025-12-19

- Added warning banner for users on the Steam Client Beta (Since legacy won't launch when you use the client beta)

[1.2.0] - 2025-12-13

- Changed update logic to allow updating if the download server can be contacted with the play button override enabled
- Changed update logic to be more reliable with multi-patch updates
- Added progress indicator for launcher updates (This is untested, but it compiled so fuck it we ball)
- Streamlined the update logic to be generally more reliable; this includes not leaving all the update logic/version checking to a single threaded function.
- Patch 1.1.8 included new update notifications for install/update states, this should also be more reliable (via the Eric/Scoobert images)
- Added additional protections for install/repair logic so that you won't wipe your suprem files because of my mistakes.
- Added additional checks for update sources so that repair/install/update functions shouldn't fail (or be permissive if the update sources are unreachable)

- Added Scoobert

[1.1.7] - 2025-12-11

Normalized CSGO pathing so the gameinfo.txt doesn't end up with /csgo/csgo by accident.

[1.1.6] - 2025-12-09

- Improved Handling of gameinfo.txt (to avoid issues when people download the repack)
- Gameinfo.txt in SupremacyRenewed/csgo will automatically update to path from settings (For users who use the repack instead of the launcher to install)

[1.1.4]/[1.1.5] - 2025-12-07

(This is a minor update but important as american ISPs are starting to block my personal websites, including the one that handles the launcher updates.)
